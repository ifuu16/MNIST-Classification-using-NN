# MNIST-Classification-using-NN

MNIST dataset used in this work is cleaned dataset readily available on tensorflow. This is image classification model. However, we flattened the image before we could to use a neural network model for the classification. The model contains an input, hidden layers, and an output. And it achieved over 80% acuracy.
